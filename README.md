# Resistor Wizard Project üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts the code for the Resistor Sorter project, developed as part of the Integration Workshops 1 course. The project's primary objective is to create a resistor sorting system that allows users to input resistors and select six resistance values. The system is implemented as a web application, with a frontend built using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React. Backend processing is handled on a Raspberry Pi 3B server running Flask, and it involves resistor position localization and color recognition using OpenCV. An AI model, trained by the project team, assists in this process.

## Project Components

### Frontend

The frontend of the Resistor Sorter project is responsible for creating the user interface where resistors can be input, and resistance values can be selected. The user interacts with the system through this web-based interface.

### Backend

The backend of the project runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B server and is implemented in Python using the Flask framework. It handles the following tasks:

- Resistor position localization
- Color recognition using OpenCV
- Communication with the frontend

### Machine-Learning Model

The ML model is a critical component of this project. It has been trained by our dedicated team to recognize resistors and resistor color bands accurately. The data used to train the model is mostly self-provided (meaning we created and labelled the data ourselves). The complete datasets can be visited at <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/uni-vug0c/metal-film-leaded-resistors-dataset">resistor dataset</a> and <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/jhony-minetto-arajo/metal-film-leaded-resistor-color-bands">resistor color bands dataset</a>.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally or on your own Raspberry Pi server, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resistor-sorter.git`
2. Set up the frontend environment and dependencies.
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Install dependencies using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
   - Start the frontend application: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
   
3. Set up the backend environment and dependencies on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Start the Flask server: `python app.py`.
   
4. Ensure the necessary hardware components are connected and configured on your Raspberry Pi for resistor input.

5. Access the web application in your browser and start using the Resistor Sorter.
